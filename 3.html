Marie-Aimée Roger-Miclos (1 May 1860 – 19 May 1951) was a French pianist of international acclaim. One reviewer described her as "an artist of interesting and unconventional qualities, possessing a strongly marked sense of rhythm, brilliant and incisive touch, and her playing is marked with certainty, that adds tonal charm to brilliancy". Camille Saint-Saëns and Joseph O'Kelly dedicated piano pieces to her, and she taught piano at the Conservatoire de Paris. Her work lives on in her recordings, which include piano pieces by Frédéric Chopin and Felix Mendelssohn.

This photograph of Roger-Miclos was taken in 1902 by Jean Reutlinger as part of volume 21 of the Album Reutlinger de portraits divers. The Reutlinger studio in Paris specialised in photographic portraits of popular actresses and opera singers, which were either sold to magazines and newspapers or reproduced as postcards.
